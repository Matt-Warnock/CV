## Matthew Warnock

I really like to delve into the details of why something works. My curiosity about technology led me to be the 'go to person' on all electronic percussion matters at John Henry's and Wembley Music Centre. This resulted in a much more efficient exchange of information and an increase in high-end e-kit sales. It also drew me to audio/visual sales, because I would spend most of my spare time looking at reviews and technical info for fun. I am driven to understand the detail so I can be better prepared to help others.

## Skills

#### Meticulous

- During my time at John Henry's it was very important that every single moving piece of hardware was tested thoroughly. Due to the detailed testing I would do and the training I implemented as a result, the company saved on transport costs and time.

#### Analytical planner

- When project managing at Bang and Olufsen I discovered that problem solving time sensitive issues is just a matter of going though the right process a step at a time. I would then review to see if we need to add or improve a process. This resulted in less callouts to the customers.
