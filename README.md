## Matthew Warnock

I really like to delve into the details of why something works. My curious mind for technologies drew me to audio/visual sales, because I would spend most of my spare time looking at reviews and technical info for fun. I am driven to understand the detail so I can be better prepared to help others. My analytical thinking and the values that the world of development seems to share is the reason I am looking forward to working in this industry.

## Skills

#### Meticulous

- During my time at John Henry's it was very important that every single moving piece of hardware was tested thoroughly. Due to the (border-line obsessive) testing I would do and the training I implemented as a result, the company saved on transport costs and time.

#### analytical plainer

- When project managing at Bang and Olufsen I discovered that problem solving time sensitive issues is just a matter of going though the right process a step at a time. I would then review to see if we need to add or improve a process. This resulted in less callouts to the customers.
